# GAME Snake


## About the game

The game in this application is Snake played by a *NEAT* (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies). *NEAT* is an algorithm which takes a batch of AIs (genomes) attempting to accomplish a given task. The top performing AIs “breed” to create the next generation. This process continues until we have a generation which is capable of completing what it needs to.
